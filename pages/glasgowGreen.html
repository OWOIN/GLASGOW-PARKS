            Glasgow Green is on the banks of the Clyde, to the east of the city
            centre. It is the oldest official park in the city and was
            established around the 15th century. The Park itself is about 136
            acres in size and was awarded the “Green Flag award” which is the
            national benchmark for green spaces and parks.

                    Glasgow Green is a large park with many enterances, but is
                    most easily accessable via a 5 minute walk for Argyle Street
                    train station.

                    The park has no gates so is never officially shut, However
                    due to its size, much of the park is not lit up at night so
                    going after dark is not recommended.

                    The park was officially given to the people of Glasgow in
                    1450 by King James II. It took about 100 years for the
                    marshland from the side of the clyde to be cleared and the
                    park became more recognisable to what we see today.

                    Nelson's Monument was constructed in 1806 and the St Andrews
                    Bridge was built in 1855 to allow an easy crossing over the
                    river from within the park. The Peoples Palace and fountain
                    were built around 1881.
