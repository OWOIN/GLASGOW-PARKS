            Victoria Park is 50 acres of formal floral displays in the west of
            Glasgow. It is dedicated to Queen Victoria I and was created to
            celebrate her golden jubilee in 1887 and is considered Glasgow’s
            prettiest park.

                    Victoria Park was named in honor of Queen Victoria I's
                    jubilee in 1887. The park was built by a workforce made up
                    of unemployed men in need of an occupation to see them
                    through a difficult period.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The gates were paid for by local women who subscribed a
                    penny each, said to be partly in gratitude for providing
                    work for their men and partly for keeping them sober.
